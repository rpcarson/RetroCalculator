### RetroCalculator

This is a basic function calculator written from scratch and graphically designed using Sketch 3.

It's themed to look like a classic calculator from the 80's. 


Its been submitted to the app store and is currently under review as Old-School Calculator  (Retro Calculator was taken NOOOOOO!!!)
