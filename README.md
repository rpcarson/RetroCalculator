### RetroCalculator

This is a basic function calculator written from scratch and graphically designed using Sketch 3.

It's themed to look like a classic calculator from the 80's. 


This app has been accepted on the app store.

This was written about 3 months after beginning to learn swift, and the code is a bit cumbersome and complicated. 
https://github.com/rpcarson/RemasteredCalculator is my latest attempt to go back and recreate the same calculator
but with more concise and readable code. While not finished, it has already drastically improved on the code I have written here.
